## üí° PRO TIPS

### Duration Optimization
- **8-16 seconds**: Simple scenes, single actions
- **24-32 seconds**: Character interactions, scene development
- **40-64 seconds**: Complex sequences, multiple actions
- **80+ seconds**: Narrative scenes, detailed storytelling

### Prompt Length Guidelines
- Keep prompts under 500 characters
- Use specific, visual language
- Avoid abstract concepts
- Include technical camera terms
- Specify lighting conditions

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ‚ùå "Beautiful" (too vague)
- ‚ùå "Amazing" (not descriptive)
- ‚ùå "Cool" (subjective)
- ‚ùå "Nice" (non-specific)
- ‚úÖ Use concrete, visual descriptions instead

### Seed Image Best Practices
- Use high-resolution images (1280x768 recommended)
- Match seed image aspect ratio to desired output
- Seed influence 0.6-0.8 for balanced results
- Higher influence (0.8-1.0) for closer matching
- Lower influence (0.3-0.6) for loose inspiration
