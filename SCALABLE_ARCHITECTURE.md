# Scalable Creator Suite Architecture
# Non-concurrent, horizontally scalable design

## Current Issues with Concurrent Architecture:
1. Complex async/await management
2. Resource contention between concurrent tasks
3. Memory usage spikes with parallel video processing
4. Difficult to debug and monitor
5. Unpredictable performance under load

## New Scalable Architecture:

### 1. Sequential Task Processing (Per Worker)
- Each worker processes ONE task at a time
- No concurrent execution within a single worker
- Predictable resource usage
- Easy to debug and monitor

### 2. Horizontal Scaling Strategy
- Multiple single-threaded workers
- Each worker dedicated to specific task types
- Queue-based load distribution
- Auto-scaling based on queue depth

### 3. Resource-Optimized Workers
- Dedicated workers for different AI providers
- Memory-efficient single-task execution
- Proper cleanup between tasks
- Restart workers after N tasks to prevent memory leaks

### 4. Smart Queue Management
- Priority queues for different user tiers
- Rate limiting per user/organization
- Fair scheduling across users
- Dead letter queues for failed tasks

### 5. Scaling Components:

#### A. Worker Specialization:
- video-worker-runway: Only Runway Gen-3 tasks
- video-worker-minimax: Only Minimax Video-01 tasks
- video-worker-veo3: Only Google Veo-3 tasks
- image-worker: Only image generation tasks
- processing-worker: Only media processing tasks

#### B. Intelligent Load Balancing:
- Route tasks to least busy workers
- Scale workers based on queue depth
- Auto-spawn workers during peak times
- Graceful worker shutdown when idle

#### C. Resource Management:
- Single GPU allocation per worker
- Memory limits per worker process
- CPU affinity for video processing
- Disk space monitoring and cleanup

### 6. Implementation Benefits:
- 🎯 Predictable performance
- 📊 Easy monitoring and alerting
- 🔧 Simple troubleshooting
- 💰 Cost-efficient resource usage
- ⚡ Fast response times
- 🛡️ Fault tolerance
- 📈 Linear scaling

### 7. Deployment Strategy:
- Docker containers for each worker type
- Kubernetes for auto-scaling
- Load balancers for API endpoints
- Separate databases for hot/cold data
- CDN for video delivery
